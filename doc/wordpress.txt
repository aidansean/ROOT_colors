<h3>Overview</h3>

Physicists use ROOT to make plots and it's often useful to be able to easily browse the color space.  ROOT provides a color wheel, but I find the rectangular display very useful as well.  In principle, colors in the same column should suit each other, which makes the rectangular display more useful than the color wheel.
